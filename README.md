# Fashion MNIST Dataset

`Fashion-MNIST` is a dataset of [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/)'s article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

Here's an example how the data looks (*each class takes three-rows*):
